 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for reporting Software.

 Creating a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a communication program requires a structured approach. Below is a concise guide based on the principles outlined in Software Architecture: Foundations, Theory, and Practice by Richard N. Taylor, Nenad Medvidovic, and Eric Dashofy.

## 1. Introduction
* Purpose: Clearly define the purpose of the communication program (e.g., enabling reliable data exchange between systems or users).
* Scope: Briefly describe the system, its objectives, and its boundaries.
* Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations: Provide clarity on terms used.
* References: List related documents, standards, or resources.
## 2. Overall Description
* Product Perspective:
Describe how the program fits into the larger system (e.g., as a standalone application or part of a distributed system).
Highlight dependencies and interactions with external systems or modules.
* Product Functions:
Summarize the main functionalities (e.g., real-time messaging, file transfer, or logging communication events).
* User Characteristics:
Define user types (e.g., administrators, end-users, or system integrators) and their expertise level.
* Assumptions and Dependencies:
Specify assumptions about the environment (e.g., network conditions, operating systems) and dependencies on other software/hardware.
## 3. Functional Requirements
Detail the core functionality with clear, testable specifications. Use structured formats like "shall" statements or use cases.

Data Exchange:
Protocol support (e.g., MQTT, HTTP/REST, WebSocket).
Format (e.g., JSON, XML, or binary).
Reliability and Delivery:
Handling message acknowledgments.
Retry mechanisms.
User Interface:
CLI, GUI, or API endpoints.
Security:
Encryption (e.g., TLS/SSL).
Authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, API keys).
## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
Define system-wide constraints and qualities.

Performance:
Latency thresholds (e.g., â‰¤200ms for messages).
Scalability (e.g., supporting 10,000 concurrent users).
Availability:
Expected uptime (e.g., 99.9%).
Maintainability:
Use of modular architectures to facilitate upgrades.
Security:
Resistance to attacks (e.g., DoS, data breaches).
## 5. System Models
Include diagrams and models to visualize the architecture:

Component and Connector (C&C) Diagrams:
Show major components like client, server, and database, and their communication connectors.
Deployment Diagrams:
Indicate where components are deployed across physical or virtual machines.
Behavior Models:
Use sequence diagrams or state diagrams to show workflows like message processing or user authentication.
## 6. Interface Requirements
Specify all external and internal interfaces:

User Interface:
GUI or API design mockups.
Hardware Interfaces:
Compatibility with specific devices or systems.
Software Interfaces:
Interaction with databases, libraries, or external APIs.
## 7. Architecture and Design Constraints
Design Patterns:
List patterns like client-server, publish-subscribe, or microservices.
Standards Compliance:
Follow specific industry standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 25010 for software quality).
## 8. Appendices
Include additional material like:
Glossary of terms.
Change history for the document.
References to tools or frameworks used.
